- Hi all! I'm @Nickatnyte1 (Nick Pietras).
- I love sports, both playing and watching, hanging out with people, playing video games and board games, and - most relevant - coding.
- I'm majoring in Computer Science and Math. I am hoping to work on robotics programming for my career.
- I prefer working on coding assignments, and I am most fluent in Python and Java, but I am willing to learn any language I need to work in.
