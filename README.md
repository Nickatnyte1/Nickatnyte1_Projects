- Hi everyone. I'm @Nickatnyte1 (Nick Pietras)
- I love sports, both playing and watching, hanging out with people, playing video games and board games, and - most relevant - coding
- I'm majoring in Computer Science and Math. I am hoping to work on robotics programming for my career.
- I would prefer to work on coding assignments, and I am most fluent in Python and Java, but I also have experience in C, SQL, R, MatLab, LaTeX, Cisco CLI, and SML, and I am always striving to learn new languages.
- I can be reached via email at nicholas.joseph.11p@gmail.com, or text by (216) 209 - 2972
